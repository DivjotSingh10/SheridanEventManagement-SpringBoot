We created a project on Sheridan events which will make it easy for students to view, purchase and participate in events that are organized in Sheridan college campuses. The project is supposed to fulfill the problem as the current system only displays the events but doesn’t allow the student to purchase tickets and can’t tell when the tickets are sold out. Thus, making it hard for the students to participate in exciting events that take place in the Sheridan community. 

The application fulfills the requirements as it allows the administration to add, edit and delete events and allows the student to only view and purchase events. Thus, making the application useful to students and they can track these in real-time.

The features that we have added to this application are:
1.	Confirmation E-mail: An email is sent to the student when they purchase tickets for any event.
2.	Password Recovery: The features allow any student to recover the password. The system sends an automated OTP (One Time Password) to the registered email address which can be used to change the password.
3.	My Tickets: This feature allows the user to view their purchased history.
4.	Cancel ticket: This feature allows the user to cancel the ticket after they have purchased them.
